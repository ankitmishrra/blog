*I am on a rock somewhere, it's the only one I know, but I know it well.*

It sometimes completely blows my mind when I try to think of the scale of the universe. The famous image of earth called "The Pale blue dot" taken by voyager 1 from beyond the saturn, first gave me a glimpse of how tiny we are. Then there are images from hubble and JWST, so astonishing that they force you to think about enormity of the known universe. I say known, because our ability to see into our past is limited by the speed of light and the farthest that we can see is 13.6 billion years, which was when time was born. The question that is this all by design or it's just random, are there any more such inhabitated worlds or are we alone, in this moment cannot be answered. But the fact that I am writing this post and thinking about this, proves for sure that I am witnessing this miracle called life. 

I am here, what shall I do now?

There are two options:
1. Go with flow, witness the magic happening around, appreciate it and leave.
2. Create a flow, be the magic, live the life designed by you and leave.

I choose option 2!
